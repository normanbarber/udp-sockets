# NodeJS User Datagram Protocol

Extending my understanding of sockets. Since I am reading about browser networking I'd like to understand more about UDP and TCP, atleast at a low level for now. Compared to TCP, UDP has a low overhead and reduced latency rather than error checking and delivery validation. Instructions for running it are below. After starting the server you can randomly generate Will Ferrel quotes by running node client from another CLI

### Running the app


Open 2 command prompts

##### In window 1:

    npm start or node server

##### In window 2:

    node client
